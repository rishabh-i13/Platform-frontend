              In his 11th successive Independence Day address to the nation from
              the ramparts of the Red Fort, Prime Minister Narendra Modi gave a
              renewed push to the BJP’s ideological aim of a Uniform Civil Code,
              reframing the idea as a “secular civil code” enshrined in the
              Constitution and a way of ensuring equality before law for all.
